= Introduction

Axon Framework Multitenancy Extension provides your application ability to serve multiple tenants (event-stores) at once. Multi-tenancy is important in cloud computing and this extension will provide ability to connect to tenants dynamically, physical separate tenants data, scale tenants independently...

== Requirements
Currently, following requirements needs to be meet for extension to work:

- Use *Spring Framework* together with *Axon Framework 4.6+*
- Use *Axon Server EE 4.6+* or Axon Cloud as event store
- This is not hard requirement but if you wish to enable multitenancy on projection side, only SQL databases are supported out-of-the box

== Restrictions

Only components that interact with Axon Server and or database via JPA are supported out of the box. If you wish to use other components, you need to implement multi-tenancy support for them.
